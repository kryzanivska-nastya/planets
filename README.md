### Planets

----------

***In summary, this code creates an interactive animation where clicking on the Earth causes it and the Moon to rotate(cliking again - rotates in another side). Additionally, it generates a starry background with animated stars.***

Brief overview of what this code does:
- HTML Elements:
It defines HTML elements for displaying "Planets," "Earth," and "Moon."

- JavaScript Animation:
It adds an event listener to the "Earth" element to trigger a rotation animation when it is clicked. The Earth and Moon will rotate in opposite directions.

- Rotate Function:
This function handles the rotation of the Moon around the Earth's orbit. It updates the Moon's rotation angle based on a toggle and applies a CSS transform to achieve the rotation effect.

- Star Animation:
It generates a starry background by creating multiple HTML elements with a "star" class. Each star has a random position, color, and animation delay.
